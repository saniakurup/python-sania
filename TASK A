Here's a task for students to write Python code using if-elif statements and a for loop:

Task: Grade Calculator

Write a Python program that takes the marks scored by a student as input and calculates their grade based on the following criteria:

If marks >= 90, grade is 'A'
If 80 <= marks < 90, grade is 'B'
If 70 <= marks < 80, grade is 'C'
If 60 <= marks < 70, grade is 'D'
If marks < 60, grade is 'F'
Additionally, the program should print a message indicating whether the student passed or failed based on whether their grade is 'A', 'B', 'C', or 'D' (i.e., excluding 'F').

Your program should prompt the user to enter the marks scored by the student, calculate their grade, and print the grade along with the pass/fail message.

Example Output:
Enter the marks scored by the student: 85
Grade: B
Pass
mathematica


Enter the marks scored by the student: 55
Grade: F
Fail


Your task is to write the Python code to implement this program using if-elif statements and a for loop to handle multiple students if desired.
